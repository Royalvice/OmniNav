# IK Controller Configuration
# For Go2 quadruped locomotion demo (IK-based)

type: ik_controller
mode: physics
gait_type: trot

# Gait parameters
step_height: 0.08     # Meters (foot lift height during swing)
step_length: 0.25     # Meters (stride length - larger = faster movement)
gait_frequency: 2.5   # Hz (faster gait cycle)
body_height: 0.28     # Meters (standing height from ground)

# Simulation parameters
dt: 0.01

# Foot link names (Target Calf links because FL_foot is merged)
foot_links:
  - FL_calf
  - FR_calf
  - RL_calf
  - RR_calf

# Offset from Calf origin to Foot center (from URDF)
# FL_foot_joint origin is 0 0 -0.213
foot_offset: [0.0, 0.0, -0.213]

# Debug
debug: false
